# Pandemic Simulation

An SIR simulation of the spread of a virus inside a population. The number of contacts is modelled using a poisson distribution, and the contacts are between random individuals.

Improvements on this model would use a `group` class to model contacts within groups such as families and workplaces more accurately.
